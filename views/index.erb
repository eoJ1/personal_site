<h1>Joseph Simmons</h1>
<p>Hi. I'm a Ruby/Rails developer from London, UK.</p>
<p>I come from an SEO background, which has given me plenty of experience writing scrapers and bots. I've previously built API wrappers and pseudo-APIs for major UK banks. </p>
<p>I've also worked heavily in Bitcoin, building a CRM from the ground up that handled all aspects of the sales process, including automating customer service.</p>
<p>I love projects of all shapes and sizes, but especially automation & web-apps. I have experience in Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, Git, Heroku, PHP, Jquery, JS, HTML, and CSS. </p>
<br />
<p>My standard rate is &#163;25/hour. If you'd like something built, get in touch through Skype. My user ID is <strong>moocowsmoo</strong>.</p>
